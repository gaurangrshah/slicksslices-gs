Example Env:

```env
SANITY_TOKEN=<SANITY_API_TOKEN>
GATSBY_PAGE_SIZE=4
GATSBY_HOT_LOADER=fast-refresh
MAIL_HOST=smtp.ethereal.email
MAIL_USER=<providedemail@ethereal.email>

```





Prerequisites:

[gatsby cli](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/gatsby-cli/)

```shell
npm install -g gatsby-cli
```

[sanity cli](https://www.sanity.io/docs/getting-started-with-sanity-cli)

```shell
npm install -g @sanity/cli
```



> `eslint`

> ensure eslint if enabled in the sanity directory.  -- search for ""@recommended" extensions in vscode for more info. 



### Wrapping page elements, automatically:

```jsx
// gatsby-browser.js

import React from 'react';
import Layout from './src/components/Layout';

const WrapPageElement = ({ element, props }) => (
  <Layout {...props}>{element}</Layout>
);

export default WrapPageElement;
```

copy the same content to the `gatsby-ssr.js` file as well, so that this function is available both in the browser and in any other context. 

```js
// gatsby-ssr.js

import React from 'react';
import Layout from './src/components/Layout';

const WrapPageElement = ({ element, props }) => (
  <Layout {...props}>{element}</Layout>
);

export default WrapPageElement;
```







Sanity Import sample data

```shell
sanity dataset import <GZIP_FILE_PATH> production
```

You can also re-hyrdate with this data again, by running:

```shell
sanity dataset import <GZIP_FILE_PATH> production --replace
```





Gatsby Hot Reload:

```shell
#.env.development

GATSBY_HOT_LOADER=fast-refresh
```





Wrapping Root Element:

The way gatsby navigates and refreshes makes it hard to persist local state on liked you'd need to for a functional "shopping cart" feature. In order to have state persist when navigating back and forth, we must wrap the root element with the state we want persisted. 

```js
//gatsby-browser.js // gatsby-ssr.js

export function wrapRootElement({ element }) {
  return <ContextProvider>{element}</ContextProvider>;
```

> The root element is never unmounted and therefore will allow you to persist state throughout the application when necessary.
>
> 
>
> 🤔 *can this work persist on refresh as well?*

#### Serverless Functions

create two files in the project root: 

```toml
# netlify.toml

[build]
  functions = "functions/"
```

```js
// functions/hello.js

exports.handler = async (event, context) => {
  console.log(event);
  return {
    statusCode: 200,
    body: 'Hello!!',
  };
};
```

> generally speaking the folder structure in the functions folder typically will have a folder for each function file. This allows us to install dependencies for specific functions if neccessary. [see more](#addDependencies)





update package.json:

```json
"scripts": {
  "netlify": "netlify dev",
}
```



execute: 

```shell
yarn netlify
```

>  **NOTE:** running this will proxy your localhost to a new port, netlify will be able to proxy our actual gatsby localhost for us, but will now  have access to netlify functions in locally as well.



The new proxy can normally be accessed at : 

[`http://localhost:8888/.netlify/functions/hello`](http://localhost:8888/.netlify/functions/hello)





<a name="addDependencies">.</a>

### Add function dependencies

Initialize a new npm project:

```shell
cd functions

mkdir hello

cd hello

npm init
```



we can install packages for each individual function allowing us to install specific dependecies for each function. 

```js
functions
└── hello
		└── package.json
		└── package-lock.json
    └── hello.js
```



---





### Sending Emails via Serverless Functions

- add the following package to our function directory:

```shell
yarn add nodemailer
```

```js
// functions/placeOrder.js

const nodemailer = require('nodemailer');
// https://nodemailer.com/usage/

// create a transport for nodemailer
const transporter = nodemailer.createTransport({
  // smtp email setup
  host: process.env.MAIL_HOST,
  port: 587,
  auth: {
    user: process.env.MAIL_USER,
    pass: process.env.MAIL_PASS,
  },
});

exports.handler = async (event, context) => {
  // Test send an email
  const info = await transporter.sendMail({
    from: "Slick's Slices <slick@example.com>",
    to: 'orders@example.com',
    subject: 'New order!',
    html: `<p>Your new pizza order is here!</p>`,
  });
  console.log(info);
  return {
    statusCode: 200,
    body: JSON.stringify(info),
  };
};

```

> [`http://localhost:8888/.netlify/functions/placeOrder`](http://localhost:8888/.netlify/functions/placeOrder)



- basic ecommerce logic:  
  - asynchronously submit order
  - set loading and error states -- disable form during loading state
  - configure nodemailer to send order emails
  - validate order data server-side (ALWAYS BEFORE it enters a database or is used otherwise)
  - -- return errors if any
  - -- else return success response.
  - display success or errors to user. 





##### Add Honey Pot field to protect forms against spam bots

> honey pot fields are not supposed to displayed to the user, and therefore are not meant to be filled out. 
>
> ```jsx
> <input
>   type="honney-pott"
>   name="honney-pott"
>   className="honney-pott"
>   id="honney-pott"
>   value={values.honney-pott}
>   onChange={updateValue}
>   />
> ```
>
> ❗️**NOTE:** bots may actually look for the words "honey" and "pot" so it's best to disguise the field in some manner.
>
> 
>
> ```css
> .honney-pott {
>   display: none;
> }
> ```
>
> **❗️NOTE** we need to hide this field from the user and screen readers, while ensuring that bots can still see it:
>
> 
>
> This means that if this field does get filled, it is not a human user that is filling it out -- which tells us that a bot is filling out this form. 
>
> ```js
> // check if honey-pot field is filled out:
> if (body.honney-pott) {
>   return {
>     statusCode: 400,
>     body: JSON.stringify({
>       message: 'Boop beep bop zzzzst good bye err: #002121211001',
>     }),
>   };
> }
> ```
>
> We can then simply reject that action by throwing a cyptic error from the server. 





#### Create a store settings page in Sanity

1. define schema for the settings page: 

   ```js
   import { MdStore as icon } from 'react-icons/md';
   
   export default {
     // Computer Name
     name: 'storeSettings',
     // visible title
     title: 'Settings',
     type: 'document',
     icon,
     fields: [
       {
         name: 'name',
         title: 'Store Name',
         type: 'string',
         description: 'Name of the pizza',
       },
       {
         name: 'slicemaster',
         title: 'Slicemasters Currently Slicing',
         type: 'array',
         of: [{ type: 'reference', to: [{ type: 'person' }] }],
       },
       {
         name: 'hotSlices',
         title: 'Hot Slices available in the case',
         type: 'array',
         of: [{ type: 'reference', to: [{ type: 'pizza' }] }],
       },
     ],
   };
   
   ```

   

2. export the new schema to make it available in the sanity client side:

   ```js
   // schema.js
   
   
   import pizza from './pizza';
   import toppings from './toppings';
   import person from './person';
   import settings from './storeSettings';
   
   export default createSchema({
     name: 'default',
     types: schemaTypes.concat([pizza, toppings, person, settings]),
   });
   
   ```

   

3. register the a new sidebar override file from the root of the project

   ```js
   // sanity.json
   
   
   "parts": [
       {
         "name": "part:@sanity/desk-tool/structure",
         "path": "./sidebar.js"
       }
     ]
   ```

   

4. Create a new sidebar -- which will allow us to define our own constraints, such as limiting the amount of sidebar settings pages.

   ```js
   import React, { Children } from 'react';
   import S from '@sanity/desk-tool/structure-builder';
   
   // build a custom sidebar
   export default function Sidebar() {
     return S.list()
       .title(`Slick's Slices`)
       .items([
         // create new sub item
         S.listItem()
           .title('Home Page')
           .icon(() => <strong>🔥</strong>)
           .child(
             S.editor()
               .schemaType('storeSettings')
               // make a new document ID, so we don't have a random string of numbers
               .documentId('downtown')
           ),
         // add in the rest of our document items
         ...S.documentTypeListItems().filter(
           (item) => item.getId() !== 'storeSettings'
         ),
       ]);
   }
   ```

**NOTE** the data we pull from sanity may update, but our build won't necessarily update, so instead of pulling this data from gatsby's graphql api, we could opt to directly pull it in via sanity's own graphql API.



#### Look up graphql endpoint from sanity:

```shell
➜ sanity graphql list

Here are the GraphQL endpoints deployed for this project:
1.  Dataset:     production
    Tag:         default
    Generation:  gen2
    Playground:  true
    URL:  https://<your-sanity-api.io>/v1/graphql/production/default
```

**📣 NOTE**: there will be several differences between your sanity graphql queries and your gatsby queries, due to the fact that they both handle your data a bit differently.

example: `gatsby: allSanityPizza`  vs  `sanity: allPizza`

example: `gatsby: id`  vs  `sanity: _id`



In order to use your new sanity api make sure it's deployed to production:

**❗️NOTE: ** make sure you enable the graphql playground option

```shell
➜ sanity graphql deploy production


Dataset: production
Tag: default

✔ Checking for deployed API
? Do you want to enable a GraphQL playground? Yes
✔ Generating GraphQL schema
✔ Validating GraphQL API
✔ Deploying GraphQL API
GraphQL API deployed to:
https://7okf7mas.api.sanity.io/v1/graphql/production/default
```



Sanity allow external URL queries from sanity settings: 

https://manage.sanity.io/projects/7okf7mas/settings/api

add a new entry to allow all localhost proxies, if deployed u can include your website address as well. 

```shell
http://localhost:*
```

#### Fake GraphQL Syntax highlighting support

```js
const gql = String.raw;
```

> processes any template literall following "gql" as a raw string

```js
        query: gql`
          query {
            StoreSettings(id: "downtown") {
              name
              slicemaster {
                name
              }
              hotSlices {
                name
              }
            }
          }
        `,
```

 





#### Sanity URL Param Image Sizing:

```jsx
<img src={`${item.image.asset.url}?w=500&h=400&fit=crop`} />
```

- Low quality image placeholder setting:

```jsx
<img 
  src={`${item.image.asset.url}?w=500&h=400&fit=crop`} 
   style={{
    background: `url(${item.image.asset.metadata.lqip})`,
    backgroundSize: 'cover',
  }}
/>
```





### Deploying Sanity Studio

> ❗️ ENSURE THAT THERE IS A `/static` folder already in the root directory -- **then run deploy**



```shell
➜ sanity deploy                                                    

✔ Checking project info

```





### Building and deploying Gatsby

```shell
yarn build
```

**❗️ BE SURE TO ADD A .GITIGNORE FILE**

```shell
git init
git status
git add .
git commit -m "init commit"
```

- push repo to github 
- then login to netlify with github login
- select repo to delpoy
- and click deploy

❗️REMEMBER TO ADD .env variables.



⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ **ALLOW YOUR SITE ACCESS TO SANITY'S BACK END**:

https://manage.sanity.io/projects/7okf7mas/settings/api

- Copy And Paste the New Origin Url 
- **DO NOT NEED ALLOW CREDENTIALS**

![image-20201008223904801](https://tva1.sinaimg.cn/large/007S8ZIlly1gjivslygxxj30s009qaap.jpg)







### Setup Gatsby Build Webhook from Sanity

https://www.sanity.io/blog/how-to-quickly-set-up-a-gatsby-js-jamstack-website-with-a-headless-cms

> **Netlify**:  **Settings** -> **Build & Deploy** and scroll down to **Build Hooks**. Choose **Add build hook**, give it a name, and point to the branch you want to build from. Copy the URL, and return to the terminal:

![image-20201008231514311](https://tva1.sinaimg.cn/large/007S8ZIlly1gjiwuh44myj30jh0bg3z6.jpg)

> completing this will give you a url which we can then use to configure sanity... everytime this url is hit it with a POST request this will trigger a re-build



- From the `/sanity` in your terminal run:

```shell
sanity hook create
```

![image-20201008232013701](/Users/bunty/Library/Application Support/typora-user-images/image-20201008232013701.png)



Now we can make updates in sanity and trigger our build automatically! 





### Deploy to a private sever (i.e, digital ocean)

in order to deploy to a server where our site may not be being served from the root directory, in that case we'll need to prefix the build with the path that our site can be found at:

1. Add a pathPrefix to gatsby-config:

```js
// gatsby-config.js	

export default {
  
  pathPrefix: `/path-to-site`,
  
  siteMetadata: {
    
    /* ... ... */
  
  }
}
```



Now we can build with the prefix we defined, and use that to prefix all of our website paths during the build process:

```shell
yarn build -- --prefix-paths 
```

 

❗️Also make sure to add your new site to the "Allowed Origins" in sanity studio:
